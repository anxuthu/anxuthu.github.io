Welcome to my personal website! My name is An Xu.

I'm currently an applied scientist at Amazon.com working on shopping LLM. I received my Ph.D degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Pittsburgh where I worked with Dr. Heng Huang. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University.

Feel free to reach out via email (annnxu [at] amazon [dot] com) for collaboration!

We are hiring applied scientist interns on long context LLM.
