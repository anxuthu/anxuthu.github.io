Welcome to my personal website! My name is An Xu.

I'm currently a research scientist at TikTok working on foundation large language models. I received my Ph.D degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Pittsburgh where I worked with Dr. Heng Huang. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration!
